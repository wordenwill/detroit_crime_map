(initial mapbox image)
       This initial visualization was developed by plotting circles at the center of each census tract, coloring them by the percentage of properties that need boarding, and sizing them by the crime count. The result is a map that conveys insights in an efficient manner. We can see that blight appears concentrated in the Northeast and central sections of the city. Hamtramck and Highland Park are independent municipalities and thus not represented in Detroit’s data. It is interesting to note the high number of crimes on the waterfront at the center of the city despite this area’s low amount of blight. On the other side, many inner city census tracts have lower incidents of crime despite very high levels of blight. These observations run counter to my hypothesis and seems to confound the research that was done in Philadelphia and New Orleans. This is an issue worth exploring and I would like my data visualization to support some additional insight. However, there are also a couple of shortcomings in this visual technique that I believe can be improved on. Plotting circles at the centers of census tracts gives us a good approximation of where those tracts are located but it does not give us a sense of the size of each tract. This could be important since a larger census tract may have more people and higher crime counts. The US Census Bureau tries to define each tract so that it contains between 2,500 and 8,000 people; but this is a large range and could result in very different outcomes for the number of crimes committed in that neighborhood. I expect that understanding the geographical scope of the tract will add context to the metrics we are exploring. 
	I can add geographical detail to the census tracts because my GEOJSON contains the coordinates for each tract’s polygonal outline. After mapping the tract boundaries I experimented with different ways to encode my two variables. I tried to overlay the circles on top of the census tract boundaries and continuing to size them according to crime counts. This cluttered the map and many of the circles obscured the tract boundary underneath them. During subsequent research, I came upon some examples of 3-D extrusion mapping. With this technique I can use data to alter the height of each polygon as it is represented in 3-D space. This allows me to preserve the census tract shapes while also using them to convey numerical information. Mapbox offers a very performant option to produce such visualizations, and the maps can be customized using CSS and JavaScript code. This level of customization was important to me so that I could ensure my visual stayed accurate and loyal to the underlying data. I created a fill-extrusion map which allowed me to map out the census tracts, color each tract according to the percent of properties that needed boarding, and then set the height of each tract according to its crime count. I also added some interactivity, a legend, and some navigation tips using underlying JavaScript. This was accomplished with the help of JSFiddle, a free online software tool that provides a working environment for combining CSS, HTML, and JavaScript code. The resulting visual can be seen in Figure ? and the fully interactive version is available at ?
